# Topic
The research question our group explores is if we can acurately predict whether a person will have a stroke based on the preexisting conditions. We chose this topic because strokes are very relevant in the medical field which garnishes lots of attention. <br><br>

# Technologies Used <br>

## Data Cleaning and Analysis
In this project, we aim to explore and analyze the "stroke_data" dataset. The dataset comprises of common characteristics (such as age, occupation, marital status, etc.) associated to stroke risk. In order to properly analyze the dataset, we use the Python library 'Pandas' to clean and organize our data. The programming language R will be used to conduct any furhter statistical analysis. 

## Database Storage
Using the Python library SQLAlchemy, we will connect our notebooks to PostgreSQL (our method of database storage). To display our data, we will be using github pages.

## Machine Learning
Using the ML library SciKitLearn, we will be training and testing our model to predict whether a patient will have a stroke based on other attributes. Using various of supervised learning algorithms, we aim to achieve two things:
- Our goal is to have our model accurately assign test data to their actual class. In this case, we hope our model to predict correctly whether the entry has had a stroke or not
- We also strive for our model to understand the relationship between the dependent and independent variables. In this case, we seek to see the relationship between the different characteristics in a person and their chance of stroke

## Dashboard
Using Github pages, we will  integrate D3.js for a fully functional and interactive dashboard to display the conclusions of our anaylsis. We will incorporate Tableau to aid with our visualizations of the data.
